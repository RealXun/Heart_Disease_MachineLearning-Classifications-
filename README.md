# Heart Disease Machine Learning (Classifications)

# Overview
I will be working with the heart disease prediction and for that, we will be looking into the heart disease dataset. Our aim is to detect the probability of person that will be affected by a savior heart problem or not.

I will use libraries available in Python for data loading, management, and building models, such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-Learn
